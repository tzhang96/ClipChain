# Chains Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Chains feature allows users to create, manage, and share curated collections of videos. Chains are ordered lists of videos that can be liked and shared, providing a new way for users to organize and discover content.

## Data Model

### ChainDocument âœ“
```dart
class ChainDocument {
  String id;
  String userId;
  String title;
  String? description;
  int likes;
  List<String> videoIds;  // Ordered list of video IDs
  Timestamp createdAt;
  Timestamp updatedAt;
}
```

### Firestore Structure âœ“
```
/chains/{chainId}
  - id: string
  - userId: string
  - title: string
  - description: string?
  - likes: number
  - videoIds: array<string>
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp

/chainLikes/{likeId}
  - userId: string
  - chainId: string
  - createdAt: timestamp
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ“
- [x] Create ChainDocument class in types/firestore_types.dart
- [x] Create ChainProvider for state management
  - [x] Basic CRUD operations
  - [x] Chain fetching (by user, global)
  - [x] Chain likes management
- [x] Add chains collection to Firestore âœ“
- [x] Update security rules for chains âœ“
- [x] Add necessary Firestore indexes âœ“

### Phase 2: Core UI Components ðŸš€
- [x] Create ChainGridView widget (similar to VideoGridView)
  - [x] Display chain title and thumbnail
  - [x] Show video count
  - [x] Add like button/count
- [x] Add Chains tab to Profile screen
  - [x] Update TabData to support chains
  - [x] Add chains grid view
- [x] Create Chain creation interface
  - [x] Title and description input form
  - [x] Video selection interface
    - [x] Grid view of user's videos
    - [x] Multi-select functionality with visual feedback
    - [x] Selected videos preview
  - [x] Save/cancel actions
  - [x] Loading and error states
- [x] Add "Add to Chain" button in video feed
  - [x] Chain selection dialog
    - [x] List of existing chains
    - [x] Loading and error states
  - [x] Success/error feedback
- [ ] Create ChainFeedSource for navigation ðŸ‘ˆ Next Priority
  - [ ] Create ChainFeedScreen for viewing chain contents
  - [ ] Implement buildReturnScreen
  - [ ] Handle chain-specific navigation

### Phase 3: Chain Management
- [ ] Chain editing interface
  - [ ] Update title/description
  - [ ] Add/remove videos
  - [ ] Reorder videos
- [ ] Chain deletion with confirmation
- [ ] Chain sharing functionality
- [ ] Chain viewing interface
  - [ ] Grid view of chain contents
  - [ ] Sequential video playback option

### Phase 4: Social Features
- [ ] Chain likes system
  - [ ] Like/unlike functionality
  - [ ] Liked chains tab in profile
- [ ] Chain discovery features
  - [ ] Popular chains section
  - [ ] User recommendations
- [ ] Chain sharing options
  - [ ] Deep linking support
  - [ ] Share sheet integration

## Design Decisions

### Navigation Pattern
- Chains will follow the existing FeedSource pattern for consistent navigation
- Chain viewing will use a modified version of VideoFeedScreen for familiarity

### State Management
- ChainProvider will handle all chain-related state
- Will use the same Future.microtask pattern as other providers for consistency
- Clear separation between chain and video states

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of chain contents
- Efficient caching of chain data
- Pagination for chain lists
- Smart preloading of next videos in sequence

### Security Rules
```
match /chains/{chainId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  allow update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}

match /chainLikes/{likeId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

## User Experience Guidelines

### Chain Creation
1. Quick creation from feed:
   - Single tap "Add to Chain"
   - Select existing chain or create new
   - Immediate feedback on success

2. Dedicated chain creation:
   - Access via Create tab
   - Title and description first
   - Video selection interface
   - Reordering capability

### Chain Management
- Intuitive drag-and-drop reordering
- Quick actions for common operations
- Clear feedback for all actions
- Confirmation for destructive actions

### Chain Viewing
- Grid view by default
- Option for sequential playback
- Clear indication of chain ownership
- Easy access to like/share actions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] ChainDocument serialization
- [ ] ChainProvider CRUD operations
- [ ] Chain ordering logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Chain creation flow
- [ ] Video addition to chains
- [ ] Chain viewing experience

### UI Tests
- [ ] Chain grid layout
- [ ] Reordering interface
- [ ] Add to chain dialog

## Future Considerations
- Collaborative chains
- Chain categories/tags
- Chain comments
- Chain analytics
- Chain monetization options
