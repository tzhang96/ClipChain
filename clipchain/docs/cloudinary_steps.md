# Cloudinary Implementation Steps

## Overview
This document outlines the steps for implementing Cloudinary as our primary video storage solution in ClipChain.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Configuration Setup
- [x] Add dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  cloudinary_sdk: ^latest_version
  flutter_dotenv: ^latest_version
  ```
- [x] Create `.env` file in project root:
  ```
  CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dyqnuklvv
  CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
  CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
  ```
- [x] Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- [x] Create configuration class for Cloudinary credentials

### 2. Cloudinary Service Implementation
- [x] Create `CloudinaryService` class for video operations
- [x] Implement basic video upload functionality
- [x] Implement video URL generation with lower quality settings
- [x] Add error handling and logging
- [x] Implement URL-based optimizations

**Implementation Notes:**
- Simplified upload process to use minimal parameters
- Using URL transformations for video optimization
- Applied lower quality settings for better emulator performance:
  - Width: 480px
  - Quality: auto:low
  - Bitrate: 500k
  - Format: MP4
  - Crop: limit mode

### 3. Video Feed Screen Updates
- [x] Remove Firebase Storage handling
- [x] Update video player initialization to use Cloudinary URLs
- [x] Add Cloudinary-specific optimizations
- [x] Implement video controls (play/pause)

### 4. Upload Implementation
- [x] Create Cloudinary upload UI
- [x] Implement upload progress tracking
- [x] Add error handling and retry logic
- [x] Update Firestore document structure

**Upload Features:**
- Video selection from gallery
- Progress tracking during upload
- Description field
- Error handling and user feedback
- Automatic navigation back to feed after successful upload

## File Structure Changes
```
lib/
  ├── config/
  │   └── cloudinary_config.dart ✓
  ├── services/
  │   └── cloudinary_service.dart ✓
  └── screens/
      ├── video_feed_screen.dart ✓
      └── upload_video_screen.dart ✓
```

## Testing Steps
1. [x] Test Cloudinary configuration
2. [x] Verify video uploads
3. [x] Test video playback
4. [x] Test video optimization settings
5. [x] Test error scenarios

## Security Considerations
- Store credentials in `.env` file ✓
- Never commit API credentials to version control ✓
- Implement proper error handling ✓
- Add upload size limits and validations

## Performance Optimizations
- Using URL-based transformations for video optimization:
  - Width: 480px (16:9 aspect ratio)
  - Quality: auto:low
  - Bitrate: 500k
  - Format: MP4
  - Crop: limit mode

## Benefits
- Improved video streaming performance
- Better CDN distribution
- Automatic video optimization
- Simplified storage management
- Enhanced video playback experience

## Notes
- Legacy Firebase Storage videos will no longer work
- All new uploads use Cloudinary exclusively
- Using URL transformations for optimizations
